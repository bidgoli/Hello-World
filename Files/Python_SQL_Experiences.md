# My experiences with Python and SQL






Besides my jobs, I have had some serious experiences with both Python and SQL. Including some projects I was collaborating with and some national/international contests I have participated in. I have written a broad explanation for you, feel free to ask for more detail for each of them.


## Career

### My current position; Guest researcher at Nijmegen

My current job as a researcher is more related to mathematics rather than computer science. I am working on finding the root of the preferential attachment networks which are important in social network analysis due to their power law degree distribution. The problem itself is abstract and require probabilistic methods to solve, however, I am using Sage and Matlab for implementation to get ideas.

### Previous position; Data analyst at Café Classic

As a data analyst my job was acquiring data of users activities and analyze them. Mainly for fraud detection and finding fake IDs but I also provided a model for promotion of users. I was using ad-hoc analysis on users activities (likes, posts,…) and also some basic NLP methods to find fake users. Since the size of data was affordable, I just used Pandas for preprocessing and analyzing data.




 
## Projects

### Oil well startup
It is a startup concerning private oil well companies. One of the objectives of the application is to automize reporting system of drilling machines. My job was to design a model to detect the status of the system based on data recieving from sensors.
I used Python to create an ad-hoc model specific for them after learning basics about extraction process.

### Smuggling detection
I helped a project in *Iran Customs Administration*, as an anomality detector. The goal was to find smuggling based on data measured at the border and data claimed by the merchants.
To find anomalies which was suspicious to be smuggling. I used SQL for preprocessing and Matlab for analyzing.

 
## National competitions

### Alibaba travels contest
Another national contest with rather small data (300 MB) of flight bookings. Since the size of data was affordable I only used Python to manipulate it. For prediction, I used lightgbm regressor (which is a boosting algorithm) in Python to build a model for prediction. I achieved the 1st place.

### DECA, big data contest
It was a national data mining contest operating on a 10 GB data of push notification. The mission was to predict which user likes which kind of notification. The data was real and super messy distrusted in several files. I used SQL to prepare data and Python implement a deep neural network for classification. I achieved the 6th place in Iran.

 
## Kaggle competitions
 

### Newyork taxi fare prediction
It is probably the best success I had since it was an international competition with high level competitor. The mission was to predict fee of taxi ride based on their pick up and drop off location. The data was about 2GB and I again used lightgbm to reach 25th place which is in top 2%.

### Quick draw
It was a challenging competition. The simplified version of data which I worked with was about 8 GB. The job was to Label doodling draw by people. I used Convolutional Neural Network in Python to implement a model. I achieved top 30% which is not a good result but I learned a lot in this competition.
