# Who am I?
I am a third year Ph.D student at [IPM](http://ipm.ir/) under supervision of [Omid Etesami](http://math.ipm.ir/~etesami/) and [Behruz Tayfeh-Rezaie](http://math.ipm.ac.ir/~tayfeh-r/). My field of study is [Probabilistic Combinatoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_method).
Nowadays, I'm visiting Prof. [Ross Kang](https://www.math.ru.nl/~rkang/) at [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/english). 

I'm currently:

- Working on a percolation problem
- Reading '(Religion for Atheists: A Non-Believer's Guide to the Uses of Religion)[https://www.alaindebotton.com/religion/]' by Alain de Botton
- Learning Machine Learning!
